# Jackson Annotation Examples

* `@JsonAnyGetter` -  allows the flexibility of using a Map field as standard properties.
* `@JsonGetter` -  is an alternative to the @JsonProperty annotation to mark the specified method as a getter method.
* `@JsonPropertyOrder` -  is used to specify the order of properties on serialization.
* `@JsonRawValue` -  is used to instruct the Jackson to serialize a property exactly as is.
* `@JsonRootName` -  is used – if wrapping is enabled – to specify the name of the root wrapper to be used.
